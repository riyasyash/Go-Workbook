# Go-bites
This repository contains sample and basic programs that i try to solve using Go.
I am using the examples on the website https://gobyexample.com/switch 
I will follow these examples and use them to build some more complicated logics.
For setup and instructions please refer the wiki https://github.com/riyasyash/Go-bites/wiki

```shell
go run hello-world.go #to build and run the program
go build hello-world.go #to just build
./hello-world # to run after build
```
