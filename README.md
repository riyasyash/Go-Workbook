# Go-bites
This repository contains sample and basic programs that i try to solve using Go.
I am using the examples on the website https://gobyexample.com/switch 
I will follow these examples and use them to build some more complicated logics.
For setup and instructions please refer the wiki https://github.com/riyasyash/Go-bites/wiki
